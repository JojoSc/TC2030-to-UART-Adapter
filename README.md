# TC2030-to-UART-Adapter
Adapter to connect the TC2030 IDC cable to a USB-to-UART Adapter. This can be used to program ESP32 boards (or any other UART compatible microcontroller) without a big footprint on the PCB.

Boot and Enable/Reset buttons are included on this board, so they don't have to be on your PCB. This saves a lot of space, since only the tiny TC2030 footprint needs to be included on the final PCB.
